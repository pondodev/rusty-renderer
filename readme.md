# rusty renderer

this project is just a simple renderer i'm writing in rust, both to get more
comfortable with rust and to learn about how 3D graphics works on a low level.

all code in this repo is based off the
[tinyrenderer repo wiki](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki) which
contains a guide for writing a software renderer in C++.
